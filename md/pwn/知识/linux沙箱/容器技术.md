# linux中的容器技术
容器：

operating-system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Such instances, which are sometimes called containers, software containers

容器的目的是进行资源隔离和控制隔离。
- 资源隔离：隔离计算资源，如CPU、RAM、DISK等。
- 控制隔离：隔离一些控制结构，如UID、PID等
Cgroup与Namespace：

资源隔离依赖于linux内核的Cgroup实现，控制隔离依赖于linux内核的namespace

The Linux kernel provides the cgroups functionality that allows limitation and prioritization of resources (CPU, memory, block I/O, network, etc.) without the need for starting any virtual machines, and also namespace isolation functionality that allows complete isolation of an applications’ view of the operating environment, including process trees, networking, user IDs and mounted file systems.

目前比较有名的容器均是基于Cgroup和namespace实现的：
- LXC:  
  LXC combines the kernel’s cgroups and support for isolated namespaces to provide an isolated environment for applications
- Docker  
  Docker containers are very similar to LXC containers, and they have similar security features. When you start a container with docker run, behind the scenes Docker creates a set of namespaces and control groups for the container.
